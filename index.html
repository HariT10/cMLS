        <h1>cMLS</h1>
        <p>As one of my hobbies is to play and watch soccer, this website will be<br> based on one of the leagues I watch. This website will be used to<br> explore all three of the Canadian teams in Major League Soccer (MLS).<br> I wanted to create a website that could show and talk more about<br> Canadian soccer, and this is just the start. “cMLS” is basically the<br> Canadian teams in Major League Soccer, which can be shown by the<br> unique logo as well. </p>

        <p>The MLS was founded in 1993, and their first season was played in<br> 1996. The league first started with only 10 teams, but now it has<br> grown to 29 teams as the popularity of soccer in the United States<br> and Canada keeps on growing. The MLS is a professional soccer<br> league comprising 29 teams, of which 26 are from the United States<br> of America and 3 are from Canada. This website will be covering the<br> three teams from Canada. The three teams are Toronto FC, the<br> Vancouver Whitecaps, and CF Montreal, formerly known as the<br> Montreal Impact.</p>
