    <h1>Vancouver Whitecaps <img src="vancLogo.png"> </h1>

    <p>The Vancouver Whitecaps are a soccer team located in the city of Vancouver. Vancouver were awarded their first and Canadaâ€™s second<br> MLS team in 2009. The Whitecaps were the 17th team to enter the MLS and began playing their games in the 2011 season. Home<br> games for the Whitecaps are held at BC Place in Vancouver, which is also shared by the Canadian Football League's BC Lions. Built for<br> both football and Canadian football, the 54,500-seat multipurpose dome debuted in 1983.</p>

    <h1>Notable Season</h1>

    <p>The Vancouver Whitecaps had their best and most notable season in 2015. They finished 2nd in the Western Conference, their best<br> ever finish in the history of the team's existence. However, their playoff run was not that impressive, as they got knocked out in the first<br> game against the Portland Timbers; the game ended 2-0. Since they did finish second during the regular season, they got a place in<br> the CONCACAF Champions League, which they lost in the semifinals. In 2015, they did end up winning the Canadian Championship.</p>
