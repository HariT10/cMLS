    <h1>Toronto FC <img src="tfcLogo.png"> </h1>

    <p>Toronto Football Club, or Toronto FC, is a soccer team located in the city of Toronto. Toronto were awarded their first and Canada’s first<br> MLS team in 2005. The team name was created on May 11, 2006. They played their first game in 2007. The team plays their home games<br> at BMO Field, which is located at Exhibition Place near the shoreline. The stadium has a capacity of 30,000. Toronto FC is operated by<br> Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE). MLSE also operated other teams in the city, like the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL),<br> Toronto Raptors (NBA), and the Toronto Argonauts (CFL).</p>

<!--Notable season-->
<div class="notableSeason">

    <h1>Notable Season</h1>

    <p>Toronto FC’s most notable season was in 2017. This is because in 2017, they won the domestic treble. They won all three trophies: the<br> MLS Cup, the Supporters' Shield, and the Canadian Championship. They were the first ever team in the MLS to win a treble. At the time,<br> they also set the record for the most points in MLS regular season history. At that time, they also came very close to winning the<br> CONCACAF Champions League. This is basically a tournament including the best teams from North America, Central America, and the<br> Caribbean. Unfortunately, Toronto FC were runners-up as they lost in a penalty shoot-out against Chivas Guadalajara.</p>

<!--Most notable game, I only did this for Toronto FC because they are my favourite team-->
<div class="notableGame">

    <h1>Notable Game</h1>

    <p>A notable game for me and many others was the second leg of the MLS Conference Finals in 2016. It was the 401 derby, Toronto FC vs<br> Montreal Impact (now called CF Montreal). This was a must-win game for Toronto FC if they wanted to advance to the MLS Cup Finals.<br> This is because they had lost the first leg in Montreal; the score was 3-2. I still remember watching them lose that game, and I was very<br> sad, but there was still hope for the second league in Toronto. I still remember going into that second leg. I was very nervous, as it was a<br> must-win game. They ended up winning 5-2 and 7-5 on aggregate. It was one of the best games I ever watched—the back-and-forth<br> action, the game going to extra time, and beating your rivals.</p>
